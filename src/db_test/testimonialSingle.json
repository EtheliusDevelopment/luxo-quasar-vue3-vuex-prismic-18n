    "first_par_bl3": " After a hearty breakfast of Ligurian focaccia, we got into our Mercedes S, bound for Florence. Our greatest fortune was being able to stay at J.K. Place, a beautiful hotel facing the city’s Cathedral. We stayed in the penthouse, where we could enjoy the beauty of the whole city from our private terrace. No doubt, one of the most delicious meals during our stay in Tuscany was at Buca Lapi, a local historic trattoria where we had the famous Fiorentina steak.",
    "second_par_bl3": "After 4 days of absolute ecstasy, a spacious Mercedes Class V awaited us, ready to take us through the green hills and breathtaking scenery, which seemed like a painting with us as the protagonists.

    "first_par_bl4": "We arrived at the Grand Hotel Convento di Amalfi, the former home of the Capuchin friars. The most evocative experience was the dinner organized just for us at the Ristorante Torre Normanna.

We said goodbye to Amalfi, and a yacht awaited us to take us to Capri at last.",
    "second_par_bl4": "We arrived at the blue island, realizing immediately that we were in what looked to be a work of art. Here we were brought to the Capri Palace Hotel & Spa, a refined and elegant luxury hotel located a few steps from Anacapri, a village as characteristic as it is quiet and far from touristy chaos. We had the most wonderful time at the Capri Beauty Farm, where they pampered us between massages and swims in the heated pool.",

Before leaving, we spent a day aboard a private boat to see some hidden places of Capri. The next morning we arrived at the port of Naples with a private yacht. From there the driver took us to the airport where we said goodbye to Vesuvius with a promise: we will be back to see you soon."
